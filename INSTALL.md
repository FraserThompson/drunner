# Installation Instructions

## Linux

### Dependencies

dRunner needs docker. You can install it with:
```
wget -nv http://drunner.s3.amazonaws.com/lin/docker-install
sudo bash docker-install
```

Then give yourself permissions to run docker with:
```
sudo adduser ${USER} docker
```

You'll need to log out then in again for the group to take effect.

### Installing dRunner
```
wget http://drunner.s3.amazonaws.com/lin/drunner-install
bash drunner-install
```

If this is the first time you've installed dRunner, log out then in again to update your profile (dRunner adds its bin directory to your path in ~/.profile).
